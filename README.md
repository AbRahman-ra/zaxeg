# (ZAXEG) ZATCA XML E-Invoice Generator

- Building an invoice generator that comply with ZATCA e-invoicing phase 2 requirements
- After [Trying to understand ZATCA API]() and [Having a look over someone's work]() for e-invoicing 2 years back, and with a bigger knowledge in Java and XML. I decided to get back to the project again, and I am very ambitious I can get something working. However, **Your Contributions are highly appreciated**

## Ultimate Goal

- Construct the bridge between the business requiremnets (ZATCA, UBL, etc...) and the Technical Requirements
- Build a package and/or an api (stack not yet decided) that allows user/client to pass some input and gets an XML compliant e-invoice

## Possible Stacks

- Public API (Stack Agnostic)
- Typescript (NPM Package)
- PHP (Composer Package)
- Java (Maven Package or a Public JAR)

## SDLC Stages

- Requirements (We are here 👈)
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment

## Changelog

- I am trying to understand the basic elements of a UBL 2.1 e-invoice, thinking out lout in [this md file](docs/01-iterating.md)
