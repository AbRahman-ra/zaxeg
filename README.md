# (ZAXEG) ZATCA XML E-Invoice Generator

- An open-source initiative to build a robust, Phase II compliant e-invoice generator for the Saudi Zakat, Tax & Customs Authority (ZATCA).
- Building an invoice generator that comply with ZATCA e-invoicing phase 2 requirements
- After [Evaluating early implementations of ZATCA API](https://github.com/AbRahman-ra/zatca-api-guideline) and [Having a look over someone's work](https://github.com/AbRahman-ra/php-zatca-xml) for e-invoicing 2 years back, and with a bigger knowledge in Java and XML. I decided to get back to the project again, and I am very ambitious I can get something working. However, **Your Contributions are highly appreciated**

## Ultimate Goal

- Construct the bridge between the business requiremnets (ZATCA, UBL, etc...) and the Technical Requirements
- Build a package and/or an api (stack not yet decided) that allows user/client to pass some input and gets an XML compliant e-invoice

## Possible Stacks

The project is currently in the system design phase. I am actively evaluating the optimal ecosystem for regional B2B integration before committing to a final stack:

- Public API (Stack Agnostic)
- Typescript (NPM Package)
- PHP (Composer Package)
- Java (Maven Package or a Public JAR)

## SDLC Stages

- [x] Requirements (We are here 👈)
- [ ] Design
- [ ] Development
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Deployment

## Changelog

- I am trying to understand the basic elements of a UBL 2.1 e-invoice, thinking out lout in [this md file](docs/01-iterating.md)
